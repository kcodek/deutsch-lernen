## Deutsch - Sentence structure

1.  __The subject__
    1. Typical subject placement. [POSITION 1] 
        * The subject usually is in [POSITION 1] in the sentence - `Ich habe einen Hund `
    2. Subject inversion. [POSITION 3]
        * To emphasize a complement or an object, it can be placed in [POSITION 1], which makes the subject move to [POSITION 3]:
        `Einen Hund habe ich`  
        * This complement can be even a subordinate clause:
           ` Während meiner Kindheit war ich sehr zufrieden ` ~ During my youth I was very happy
    3. Interrogation. Subject in [POSITION 2]
        * With interrogative sentences, the verb takes [POSITION 1] which is why it moves the subject to [POSITION 2] 
            `Hast du einen Hund? `
    4. Original imperative forms. There is no subject -` Komm jetzt her ` ~ come here now
    5. Forms added to the imperative. Subject in [POSITION 2] -` Trinken wir noch ein Bier `  ~ Let’s drink one more beer

2. __The verb__
    1. Typical placement of the conjugated verb in [POSITION 2]
        * If there is just one verb, it is placed in [POSITION 2] `Ich bin 30 Jahre alt `
        * If there are several verbs, the conjugated verb is placed in [POSITION 2] and the unconjugated one (an infinitive or a participle) in the [LAST POSITION] of the sentence. `Ich möchte Deutsch lernen` ~ I want to learn German
    2. Conjugated verb with interrogation and the imperative in [POSITION 1]
        * In interrogative sentences, the conjugated verb takes [POSITION 1] and, if there is an unconjugated one, it takes the [LAST POSITION] 
        `Haben Sie Deutsch in der Schule gelernt? ` - Did you study german in school?
        `Komm her! ` -  Come here!
    3. Conjugated verb in the last position in subordinate clauses or in relative clauses
        * In subordinate clauses or relative clauses, the conjugated verb is placed in the [LAST POSITION], moving the unconjugated verb (infinitive or participle) to the [SECOND TO LAST POSITION].
        * subordinate clauses
        `Ich glaube nicht, dass du heute kommen darfst` ~ I don't think that you may come today. "Darfst" is the conjugated verb [LAST POSITION] and "kommen" is the unconjugated verb [SECOND TO LAST POSITION].
        The subordinate conjunctions are those which make the conjugated verb go to the end of the sentence and are the following:
        `als (when), bevor (before), bis (until), dass (that), damit (so that), ob (if), obwohl (despite), seit (since), sobald (as soon as), sofern (as long as), soweit (as far as), sowie (as soon as), während (while), weil (because), wenn (if), wie (how), wo (where)`
        * Relative clauses
        `Das ist das Mädchen, das ich in der Schule gesehen habe` ~ This is the girl that I saw at school
        "Habe" is the conjugate verb [LAST POSITION] and "gesehen" is the unconjugated verb (second to last position).

3. Particles that occupy position zero (particles that have no influence)
    "Particles of position 0" means that they do not influence the order of the sentence.
    1. Conjunctions
        * There are some conjunctions that do not take a grammatical position in the sentence.
        `Ich bin müde denn ich habe wenig geschlafen` ~ I am tired because I slept little
        The following conjunctions take position 0 in the sentence: `aber, beziehungsweise, denn, oder, sondern, und`

    2. Interrogative particles
        * Interrogative particles take position 0. Therefore, the verb takes position 1 and the subject takes position 2: `Wie alt bist du? ` ~ How old are you?
        The following particles do not take a position in the sentence:
            - Pronouns : `Wer, Was, Welcher`
            - Adverbs: 
                - `Wann, Warum, Wie`
                - Wie - `Wie alt, Wie viel, Wie lange, Wie oft, Wie teuer, Wie weit`
                - Wo - `Woran, Worauf, Woraus, Wobei, Wogegen, Worin, Womit, Worüber, Worum, Wozu, Wohin, Woher`

4. Objects
    * Objects are organized in the following order:
        1. Accusative pronouns (`mich, dich, ihn, sie, es, uns, euch`)
        2. Dative pronouns (`mir, dir, ihm, ihr, ihm, uns, euch, ihnen`)
        3. Dative object (z.B.: `meiner` Mutter)
        4. Accusative object (z.B. `einen` Brief)

    * DATIVE OBJECT + ACCUSATIVE OBJECT
    `Ich schicke meiner Mutter einen Brief `  ~ I am sending a letter my mother
    * DATIVE PRONOUN + ACCUSATIVE OBJECT
    `Ich schicke ihr einen Brief ` ~ I am sending a letter to her
    * ACCUSATIVE PRONOUN + DATIVE OBJECT
    `Ich schicke ihn meiner Mutter ` ~ I am sending it to my mother
    * ACCUSATIVE PRONOUN + DATIVE PRONOUN
    `Ich schicke ihn ihr ` ~ I am sending it to her



5. Order of complements: TEKAMOLO
    * Complements are placed between the conjugated verb and the unconjugated verb:
    Complements are organized amongst themselves by following the mnemonic rule TEKAMOLO: `Temporal (TE), Causal (KA), Modal (MO), Locative (LO)`

    Herr Meier(`Subject`) hat(`Conjugated Verb`) __gestern aus Liebe im Geheimen in München__(`Compliments`) Blumen(`Acc. Object`) gekauft(`Unconjugated verb`)  ~ Out of love, Mister Meier secretly bought flowers in Munich yesterday

    `gestern(TE) aus Liebe (KA)	im Geheimen (MO) in München (LO)`

6. The particle "nicht"
    * The adverb "nicht" is the most common type of negation. By placing "nicht" in a different position, the meaning can change

    1. Nicht negating the verb
        * It makes the verb of the sentence negative when placed right before the unconjugated verb (if there is one) or at the end of the sentence:
        `Ich möchte nicht essen` ~ I don’t want to eat
        `Ich esse nicht ` ~ I don't eat

    2. "Nicht" negating a complement
        * When placed before any complement, it negates the complement
        `Ich möchte nicht jeden Tag Nudeln essen`  ~ I don’t want to eat pasta every day (every day is negated)
        * `Ich möchte nicht zu spät essen` ~ I don’t want to eat so late (so late is what is negated)
