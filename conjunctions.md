## Deutsch - Conjunctions

There are two types of German conjunctions: coordinating conjunctions and subordinating conjunctions. 

#### Coordinating conjunctions 
* coordinating conjunctions in the German language `do not affect the verb (or its position)`.
*  coordinating conjunctions link two sentences of equal importance together.

    __und__ and  
    __denn__ because  
    __sondern__	but (as in but rather, instead) 
    __aber__ but  
    __oder__ or  
    __beziehungsweise__	or, or more precisely  
    __doch__	but, however  
    __jedoch__	but, however  
    __allein__ *(rare expression)*	but unfortunately  

    - The phrase *nicht nur* is always followed by *sondern auch*.

* Two-part coordinating conjunctions
With two-part coordinations it is pretty much the same thing as with regular coordinating conjunctions: they leave the verb in the same position as in the preceding sentence.
__entweder … oder__	either … or  
__sowohl … als auch__	both … and  
__weder … noch__	neither … nor  
__einerseits, … andererseits__	on the one hand … on the other hand  
__mal … mal__	sometimes … sometimes  
__teils … teils__	partly … partly  


### Subordinating conjunctions in German
* Unlike coordinating conjunctions, German subordinating conjunctions change the position of the verb in the sentence. When encountering a subordinating conjunction, you will see that `the verb is moved to the end of the sentence`.

    __bevor__	before  
    __nachdem__	after  
    __ehe__	before  
    __seit, seitdem__	since (indicating time, not a causality)  
    __während__	while, during, whereas  
    __als__	when (in describing past events)  
    __wenn__	when (describing present and future), if, whenever  
    __wann__	when (for questions only)  
    __bis__	until, by  
    __obwohl__	although  
    __als ob, als wenn, als__	as if  
    __sooft__	as often as (whenever)  
    __sobald__	as soon as  
    __solange__	as long as  
    __da__	because  
    __weil__	because  
    __indem__	by … -ing  
    __ob__	whether*, if (*only use when you could say *whether* in English as well)  
    __falls__	in case, if  
    __wenn__	if, when  
    __um … zu__	in order to  
    __dass__	that  
    __sodass__	so that  
    __damit__	so that  

* When to use *wenn* and *als*?
* difference between *wenn* and *ob*
* difference between *nach* and *nachdem*
* difference between *seit* and *seitdem*
* difference between *da* and *weil* 
* difference between *bevor* and *ehe*
